# NET-crusader

NET-crusader is an RPG made with C# and WPF. It's based on *Scott's Open Source RPG (SOSCSRPG)*, which can be found [here](https://soscsrpg.com/)!

The main goal is to practice the MVC pattern in C#/.NET. And it's a fun way to reinforce OOP fundamentals, such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
